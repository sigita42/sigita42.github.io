title:  "Slovak speciality - bryndzove halusky"
---
As my boyfreind is of Slovak natinality, this is something he's mum and probably all mums in Slovakia are cooking. This is a real Slovak national dish everyone likes, if you have a Slovak friend - cook this and you'll definitely make a surprise! :)

Generally, these are potatoe dumplings with sheep cheese and backon. It might be a bit challanging toolwise - You'll need something to smash raw potatoes with (grater will not help!) and preferablely a dick with holes like in the picture. Also you will probably leave a big mees after cooking thise but belive me - it's worth it! :)

Ingredients for 2 porcions:

* 500g potatoes
* 200g cheese bryndza (if you can't find it, use relatively hard, salted sheep cheese)
* 300g flour 
* backon

So the process goes like this:

1. Ask some help and peal potatoes
2. Smash potatoes in very tiny pieces forming almost a porridge. 
3. Mix the potatoe mass with all the flour. The mixture needs to be almost cuttable. If the mass falls of a spoon in rather one piece alltogether then probably it's enough of flour.
4. Salt this potatoe-flour mass.
5. Boil water in a big pot and when water is ready place the disc over the pot. 





Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

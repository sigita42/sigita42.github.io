Hi, my name is Sigita! 

I'm a 25 years old cartography student close to graduation (soon, soon!:) ), I'm working and doing other things that make my life simply busy. Nevertheless, I know - to be successful in my everyday tasks, it's important to have a good meal.

There are 2 kinds of situations when I need to cook - when my boyfriend or I am hungry, or when I invite friends over. For the first case, I have following requirements - **fast, relatively healthy, relatively cheap, easy, tasty and suitable for feeding only 2 people.** For the second - **tasty and easy.** I guess pretty much what any student is looking for :) 

Over time I have managed to find very good recipes and, additionally, travelling have revealed me some delicious national treasures. To finally collect them in one place, I decided to write this blog and share them also with others.

I hope you'll find something for yourself! â™¥


*P.s. As a real Latvian, I love potatoes, so don't be surprised to find quite some potatoe recipes.*

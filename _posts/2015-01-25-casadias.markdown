Casadias originally come from South America. Also this recipe is close to the "real" one but the interpretation is truly my boyfriends (so don't judge ðŸ˜› ).

Quantity: Here we prepared in total 6 casadias that is enough for 3 people (or 2 extremely hungry people) 

Time: 40 minutes (25 minutes with some extra pair of hands ðŸ˜Š )

Ingredients:

Casadias:

* 300g chicken brest
* 200g Mozzarella cheese (preferably slightly more)
* 1 paprika
* 6 pieces of tortillas (small sized)
* spices: salt, pepper, chilli, Maggi seasoning (see the small bottle in the image below) or something similar

Guacamole Sauce:

* 2 soft avocado
* a little bit of lemon juice
* salt, pepper

So let's start with the sauce!

Take care that avocado is very soft (but still looks healthy green inside). Cut avocado open and take out the inside with a small spoon, remove the core. Add some salt and pepper, a little bit of lemon juice. For the spices - I recommend to start with a little bit and add a more after tasting. If you add too much lemon juice, you'll not feel the soft taste of avocado (special warning to avocado lovers like me). Mix it all with a mixer or spoon and the sauce is ready!

Next we should prepare the filling for tortillas!

Get ready the chicken, clean it from "ugly" parts.

You should cut it in quite small pieces. It is important when we will try to close the tortilla. This is how I cut it:

Next cut the paprika. Also try to make the pieces as small as possible:

Find a pan to bake the chicken. Heat the pan, add some oil, chicken pieces, Maggie seasoning, pepper, salt and some chilli. We like it a bit spicy but if you like softer food then you should probably skip the Maggie seasoning.

Next add shrimps and a bit of different spices - pepper, chilli, salt (careful with salt, cheese and shrimps are often already salted). Add also just a little bit of lemon juice. Basically I used juice from 1/4 of a lemon.

Add paprika and continue baking for a short moment.

Now take another pan where you could fit your tortilla, add very little amount of oil. Heat up the pan so that tortilla seem to be dipped in a cold-ish oil. However, later when the pan is hot, you should lower the heat because putting on the filling of tortilla will take some time, and tortilla might get burnt.

Now you add some Mozzarella cheese, put on the chicken filling and add more spices if you like spicy food.

Add some more cheese on top. However, I didn't have enough cheese for the last tortilla, so maybe do this step is you have more cheese than 200g.

Close the tortilla with a help of some kitchen tools and bake light brown from both sides.

Light brown!

Here is the resulting amount from the given ingredients - 6 tortillas:

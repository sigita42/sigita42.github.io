Shrimp salad is very delicious and originally comes from a recipe where shrimp salad is used as a filling for a salamon wrap. This time we wanted to prepare something simpler and faster, therefore, salad will be served with baguette.

Quantity: This salad was enough for 2 meals for 2 people. 

Time: 10 minutes

Ingredients:

* 300g clean shrimps
* 600g cream cheese (soft cheese) - 2 of the 300g packages you see in the image
* 2 paprikas
* you can see in the image 200g creme fraiche but it resulted in too liquid salad, so I won't use it next time
* a little bit of lemon juice
* spices: salt, pepper, chilli

So let's start!

Find a bowl big enough for mixing all the ingredients and first put in all the soft cheese. In the image you see I put also creme fraiche but as I said, it will be too liquid.

Next add shrimps and a bit of different spices - pepper, chilli, salt (careful with salt, cheese and shrimps are often already salted). Add also just a little bit of lemon juice. Basically I used juice from 1/4 of a lemon.

Cut some paprika, add it to the bowl and mix all the ingredients with a mixer, or use the good old spoon.

And finally you can serve it in some plate with baguette. As simple as that :)
